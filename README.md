# Underscore.js reimplemented & tested

Underscore is a popular JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks. In this repository, I reimplemented some of its methods using vanilla Javascipt and unit tested them using Mocha and Chai ☕️

## Methods

Reimplemented methods can be found in *index.js*.
By opening *index.html*, you can see the results of the tests:
